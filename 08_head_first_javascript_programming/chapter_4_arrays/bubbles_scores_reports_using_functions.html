					output = "Bubble solution #" + i + " score: " + scores[i]; // then create a string to use as a line of output that includes the bubble solution number (which is just the array index) and the score

			// And finally, we can display the bubble solutions with the highest scores. Notice weâ€™re using console.log to display the bestSolutions array. We could create another loop to display the array items one by one, but, luckily, console.log will do this for us (and, if you look at the output, it also adds commas between the array values!).
